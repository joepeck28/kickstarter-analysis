# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns for Theatre
## Examining trends regarding campaign start times and funding goals
Using the data provided I have examined the the most likely scenarios for success when attempting to fund a theatre project with Kickstarter.

### The best time to launch a campaign
The data show that the best time to launch a campaign is in the months of May, June and , with the highest number of succesful campaigns taking place in the summer months. In the graph below you can see that the highest success rate is in stark contrast to the rest of the year. Especially December which shows a steep downward trend in success rate.

### The campaign size matters
The data show that campaigns of $5000 or less have a high likelyhood of success. As the campaign size grows the rate of failure increases. Also the data show that although there were some percentage of success among larger campaigns, the overall quantity of projects was much smaller.

## The Dataset is limited
The data does not include specific geographical information regarding population density and community involvement with the arts.
